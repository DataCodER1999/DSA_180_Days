int main()
{
    // int a = 10;
    // char c = 'b';

    // a = c;

    // cout<<a; // This will give output 98 because since a is an integer datatype and c is a character data type so it can store 
    //  only integer so it will store ascii value of character

    // Lets see vice versa

    // c = a; // Now since a is a character datatype and a is an integer datatype so character with ascii value of a will be 
    // stored in c


    // but there can be scenario that integer can be so big that in cannot fit in 8 bits as a character can store only 8 bits.
    // but numbers can be bigger than 8 bits , then in that case number will be converted to bianry format and last 8 bits will
    // be considered as ascii value and character assigned to that ascii value will be stored to that variable . but this 
    // will eventually lead to data loss
