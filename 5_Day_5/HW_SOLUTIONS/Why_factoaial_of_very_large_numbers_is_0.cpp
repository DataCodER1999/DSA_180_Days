// The factorial of 50 is not 0 in C++ or any other programming language. The factorial of 50 is an extremely large number, and it cannot be represented accurately using standard data types like int or long long. If you calculate the factorial of 50 using standard data types, you'll likely get a result of 0 or some other incorrect value due to integer overflow.

// To calculate the factorial of a large number like 50 in C++, you would typically use a library that provides support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) or the Boost C++ Libraries. These libraries allow you to work with very large integers without the risk of integer overflow.

// #include <iostream>
// #include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp>

// namespace mp = boost::multiprecision;

// int main() {
//     mp::cpp_int factorial = 1;

//     for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
//         factorial *= i;
//     }

//     std::cout << "Factorial of 50 is: " << factorial << std::endl;

//     return 0;
// }

// To compile this code with GMP, you may need to link against the GMP library during compilation. Here's an example command for g++:

// g++ -o factorial factorial.cpp -lgmpxx -lgmp
